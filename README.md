# Time-table.c
 In This Program:
1. The user is prompted to enter a number using `printf` and `scanf`.
2. The entered number is stored in the variable `n`.
3. The program then uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 10.
4. Inside the loop, it calculates the product of `i` and `n` and prints the result using `printf`.
5. The loop continues until `i` reaches 10, printing the time table of `n` for each iteration.
